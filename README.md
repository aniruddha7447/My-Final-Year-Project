# 🕵️‍♂️ Fake Instagram Profile Identification & Classification using Machine Learning

A smart, secure, and interactive system built to **detect fake Instagram profiles** using machine learning techniques like Decision Tree, SVM, and Random Forest. Developed as a Final Year B.E. Project under Savitribai Phule Pune University.

> ✅ Promoting online safety by identifying malicious, bot, and spam accounts on Instagram.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

🔍 Fake Instagram profiles often spread misinformation, spam, or attempt fraud.  
📊 This project leverages **machine learning** and **profile behavior analysis** to classify profiles as **real or fake** using factors such as:

- Followers / Followings count  
- Post activity  
- Profile picture presence  
- Bio status  

It features a full **desktop GUI**, clear visual output, and performance metrics for each ML model used.

## 🧠 ML Algorithms Used

| Algorithm         | Accuracy     |
|------------------|--------------|
| Decision Tree     | 95.83%       |
| Random Forest     | 97.22% ✅     |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | 95.83%       |

Each model is trained on preprocessed Instagram account data using scikit-learn.
