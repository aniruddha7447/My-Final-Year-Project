# 🕵️‍♂️ Fake Instagram Profile Identification & Classification using Machine Learning

A smart, secure, and interactive system built to **detect fake Instagram profiles** using machine learning techniques like Decision Tree, SVM, and Random Forest. Developed as a Final Year B.E. Project under Savitribai Phule Pune University.

> ✅ Promoting online safety by identifying malicious, bot, and spam accounts on Instagram.

## 📌 Project Overview

🔍 Fake Instagram profiles often spread misinformation, spam, or attempt fraud.  
📊 This project leverages **machine learning** and **profile behavior analysis** to classify profiles as **real or fake** using factors such as:

- Followers / Followings count  
- Post activity  
- Profile picture presence  
- Bio status  

It features a full **desktop GUI**, clear visual output, and performance metrics for each ML model used.
